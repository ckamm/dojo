# Rationality Dojo helper app

## Warning

This was hacked together quickly to solve a problem. I hadn't used Meteor
before. The UI is extremely basic and only barely works. Use at your own risk.


## Features

### Forming groups

Imagine you run an event and want the participants to form groups
of three for an activity. The common options are either slow
("Please form groups!") or suboptimal (by fiat or by counting).

This app automates the group forming process while taking people's
preferences into account. It works best for recurring events where participants
can register with the app in advance.

The idea is that people will figure out whom they work well with and then
update their (private) matching settings. From then on they're more likely
to be in productive groups but not working with the same people every
time either.
